Announcement release 2020/03/xx

* mathtools and empheq is now hosted at https://github.com/latex3/mathtools 
  
* Additional ideas for math will now be added to mathtools as amsmath might not
  be the right home for them at the moment.
  
* cleared up some documentation (reported by Frank Mittelbach,, issue #1)

* Explained a bit about nested \splitfrac and their need to be added
  \mathstrut (reported by Frank Mittelbach, issue #2)

* added spaces to the arguments of \xLeftarrow, \xRightarrow and
  \xLeftrightarrow moving the arguments away from the large arrow
  head(s) (suggested by Frank Mittelbach, issue #3)

* added \xmathstrut an adjustable extention to the normal \mathstrut (issue #4)

* empheq: fixed some general issues with amsart (-book). (issue #5).
  For now using multline or single alignment column flalign may not work as expected.

* empheq: fixed an overfull \hbox issue when fleqn was active. Also
  adjusted the use of \linewidth in the code to be able to accomodate
  for amsart using fixed width displays.



Announcement release 2020/01/17

* a few typos in the manual (from  Mike Dworski)
* added \kern1sp in a few places related to showonlyrefs preventing
  equation to add extra blank lines. This fixes both
  https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/524598/3929 and
  https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/257928/3929 


Announcement release 2019/07/31

* fixed typo in manual (\Prop vs \Prob, reported by Shapour Madadpour)
* added \crampedsubstack and cramedsubarray (suggested by Henri Menke).
* added multlined hook fixes for smallmatrix and the smallmatrix variants we provide.


Announcement release 2018/01/08

* Fixed typo in \intertext, the interface for specifying the space
  above and below now works as advertised.


Announcement release 2017/10/30

* fixed \null\, bug in (l|r|)gathered versions, bringing it in line with amsmath
  Reported in https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/397718/3929


Announcement release 2017

* changed amsmath requirelemnt to 2016/11/05 (in order to use the aligend fix)

* Applied the amsmath aligned fix to multlined, now the left part aligned correctly
  Reported by campa in a note to <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/369212/3929>

* Reimplemented `\DeclarePairedDelimiter` and friends to fix the following problem:

		\mathclose{\rvert}^2 vs \mathclose\rvert^2

	They might not give the same result (depending on the font
    setup). Thus the internal wrappers need to be changed into three
    branches: star, nostarnonscaled, nostarscaled, where the
    difference between the last two is whether or not braces are
    applied to the fences.

	This problem was reported in <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/364308/3929>

* Since we were cleaning up `\DeclarePairedDelimiter` and friends,
  `\DeclarePairedDelimiterX` is now implemented as a call to `\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP`
  with empty pre- and postcode.

* The \DeclarePairedDelimiter(X,XPP) reimplementation removes a grouping issue reported in
  <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/366665/3929>

* since there is no longer any `nostar` wrapper branch, redeclaring the `nostar` wrapper
  will now give an error.

* Removed `-\jot` from the multlined implementation (invisible line). Issue reported in at
  least <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/258162/3929> and
  <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/369156/3929>. It is not 100% correct, but better than
  with `-\jot`.

* fixed bug in empheq in relation to AMS clases

* renamed macros in mhsetup, mathtools and empheq such that any xxx_yyy: macro should now
  contain EQ, MH or HT as a prefix or infix. Thus making everyting truely separate from
  expl3 defined syntax.

* changed \shortintertext such that as long as 'original-intertext=false' (the default), 
  \shortintertext now only work in the same context as \intertext

* \shortintertext is now also an error inside the empheq construction

* sporadic space fixed in \noeqref, reported by Christian Vetter (private email)

* Added \ignorespaces after \noindent, bug inherited from amsmath
