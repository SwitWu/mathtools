MAY 2017

* changed amsmath requirelemnt to require the latest amsmath version 
  (in order to use the aligend fix)
* the nostar inner wrapper for DeclarePairedDelimiter(X,XPP) have been 
  split into nostarnonscaled, nostarscaled, redefining nostar will now give an error. 
* since \delimsize no longer need to gobble when there is no scaler, the fix from 
  april have been removed.


APRIL 2017

* fixed problem in \DeclarePairedDelimiterX and \DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP 
  where a redefinition of an inner wrapper could remove grouping and \delimsize then 
  stopped working properly inside the body

MARCH 2017

* fixed bug in empheq in relation to AMS clases
* renamed macros such that any xxx_yyy: macro should now contain EQ, 
  MH or HT as a prefix or infix. Thus making everyting truely separate from expl3 
  defined syntax.
* changed \shortintertext such that as long as 'original-intertext=false' (the default), 
  \shortintertext now only work in the same context as \intertext
* \shortintertext is now also an error inside the empheq construction


JANUARY 2017

* sporadic space in \noeqref


MAY 2016

* Added \ignorespaces after \noindent, bug inherited from amsmath


MARCH 2015

* Changed the example for \Set in the manual, such that \allowbreak
  comes before the inserted proceeding space


JULY 2014

* workaround for ~\(...\) when mathic option is active
* added comment about \mathopen{} in relation to \DeclarePairedDelimiterX

Mathtools:
* robust \(\) and \[\], maintained when mathic is active
* Bug comment about multlined inside array
* Added \DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP
* Added comment about breakable auto scaling using \DeclarePairedDelimiter
* Added comment about \Aboxed and hiding &'s
