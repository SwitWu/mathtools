Announcement release 2019/xx/xx

* fixed typo in manual (\Prop vs \Prob, reported by Shapour Madadpour)
* added \crampedsubstack and cramedsubarray (suggested by Henri Menke).
* added multlined hook fixes for smallmatrix and the smallmatrix variants we provide.


Announcement release 2018/01/08

* Fixed typo in \intertext, the interface for specifying the space
  above and below now works as advertised.


Announcement release 2017/10/30

* fixed \null\, bug in (l|r|)gathered versions, bringing it in line with amsmath
  Reported in https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/397718/3929


Announcement release 2017

* changed amsmath requirelemnt to 2016/11/05 (in order to use the aligend fix)

* Applied the amsmath aligned fix to multlined, now the left part aligned correctly
  Reported by campa in a note to <https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/369212/3929>

* Reimplemented `\DeclarePairedDelimiter` and friends to fix the following problem:

		\mathclose{\rvert}^2 vs \mathclose\rvert^2

	They might not give the same result (depending on the font
    setup). Thus the internal wrappers need to be changed into three
    branches: star, nostarnonscaled, nostarscaled, where the
    difference between the last two is whether or not braces are
    applied to the fences.

	This problem was reported in <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/364308/3929>

* Since we were cleaning up `\DeclarePairedDelimiter` and friends,
  `\DeclarePairedDelimiterX` is now implemented as a call to `\DeclarePairedDelimiterXPP`
  with empty pre- and postcode.

* The \DeclarePairedDelimiter(X,XPP) reimplementation removes a grouping issue reported in
  <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/366665/3929>

* since there is no longer any `nostar` wrapper branch, redeclaring the `nostar` wrapper
  will now give an error.

* Removed `-\jot` from the multlined implementation (invisible line). Issue reported in at
  least <http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/258162/3929> and
  <https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/369156/3929>. It is not 100% correct, but better than
  with `-\jot`.

* fixed bug in empheq in relation to AMS clases

* renamed macros in mhsetup, mathtools and empheq such that any xxx_yyy: macro should now
  contain EQ, MH or HT as a prefix or infix. Thus making everyting truely separate from
  expl3 defined syntax.

* changed \shortintertext such that as long as 'original-intertext=false' (the default), 
  \shortintertext now only work in the same context as \intertext

* \shortintertext is now also an error inside the empheq construction

* sporadic space fixed in \noeqref, reported by Christian Vetter (private email)

* Added \ignorespaces after \noindent, bug inherited from amsmath
